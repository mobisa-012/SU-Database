A database to solve this problem:


The SU Automobile Company LTD, mainly dealing with selling cars and spare parts, outsources
the products from the same manufacturer, underwent restructuring to usher in a new regime. The
new management has decided to improve their system after getting used to using Microsoft
Excel and Microsoft Word to record information on clients, the sales and marketing agents and
the products. They had a time tracking their progress and had to find way to keep their services
outstanding.
The company buys the cars from manufactures and cannot keep track of the sales as a well as the
buyers. The administrators are in charge of the company. At the moment the company only has
clustered files of MS Excel and MS Word where one has to go through each of file which is
tedious. At times, there are allegations and instances of fraud and embezzlement on the wrong
party.
